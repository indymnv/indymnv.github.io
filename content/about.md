I am Navi, an industrial engineer living in Tokyo, Japan. I have previous academic experience studying optimization in emergency systems, and in the industry, I have worked in the energy and food sectors as a data analyst/scientist. 

This space is used to share knowledge about the world of quantitative methods for decision-making, technology, free software, and reflections on life. I have used different tools, preferably free and open source, but currently, I primarily use Julia and Python.
